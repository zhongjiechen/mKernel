## Highlights

- **Multi-GPU + multi-node, in one kernel.** Handling both intra-node and inter-node GPU-driven communication inside the same kernel.
- **Fine-grained intra-kernel overlapping.** Compute and communication overlap at tile/chunk granularity. 
- **Persistent kernel with SM specialization.** CTAs are assigned roles, such as compute / intra-comm / inter-send / inter-reduce. 
- **GPU-driven networking, built from scratch.** Directly implement communication over Libibverbs (without NCCL/NVSHMEM) for maximal performance.

_mKernel is under active development, including optimizing for larger scale, different GPUs, and network topologies. The goal is to have a library for commonly used multi-node/GPU distributed kernels._

## Roadmap
- ✅ Fused, GPU-driven multi-node kernels
- ✅ Add CX7 and EFA backend
- 🚧 Full support for heterogeneous accelerators and NICs
  - 🚧 Topology-aware accelerator and NIC discovery, placement, and routing
- 🚧 Internode megakernels
- 🚧 Support for Blackwell GPUs

## Kernels

| Kernel | What it fuses | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **AllGather + GEMM** | AllGather → GEMM | Each rank holds a shard of the activation `A`. While ranks gather peers' shards over NVLink/RDMA, the local GEMM consumes tiles as soon as they arrive — overlapping the gather with `(A_full @ B)` so the matmul starts before the collective finishes. |
| **GEMM + AllReduce** | GEMM → AllReduce | Computes `C = A @ B` and reduces partial outputs across all 16 ranks in one launch. Output tiles are pushed into the reduction tree the instant they're produced, hiding the AllReduce inside the GEMM tail. |
| **MoE Dispatch + GEMM** | All-to-All dispatch → grouped GEMM | Routes MoE tokens to their expert ranks (intra-node NVLink + inter-node all-to-all) and runs the per-expert grouped GEMM in the same kernel. Tokens are matmul'd as soon as they land, no staging buffer round-trip. |
| **Ring Attention** | Ring KV exchange → FlashAttention | Sequence-parallel attention across 16 ranks: each step rotates a KV chunk around the ring while the local FlashAttention consumes the previously-received chunk. Compute and the ring send/recv run concurrently inside a single persistent kernel. |
| **GEMM + ReduceScatter** | GEMM → ReduceScatter | Computes `C = A @ B` and reduce-scatters the output across ranks. Each output tile is reduced and forwarded to its owning rank as soon as it's produced, so the scatter overlaps the GEMM rather than following it. |

## Quick start

```sh
# Pick BACKEND=efa for AWS EFA, or BACKEND=cx7 for ConnectX-7 / InfiniBand.
make BACKEND=cx7 PYTHON=python3 all

# Two-node benchmark example. Run from node 0; node 1 is launched over SSH.
NODE0_IP=<node0-data-ip> \
NODE1_IP=<node1-data-ip> \
NODE1_SSH=<node1-ssh-target> \
bash bench/run.sh all bench 2

make plots
```

## Requirements

- NVIDIA Hopper GPUs; the default build targets `sm_90a`.
- CUDA 12.9 by default (`CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.9`), override with `CUDA_HOME=...`.
- Python with PyTorch installed; pass it to the build with `PYTHON=/path/to/python`.
- CX7 backend: libibverbs development headers and libraries.
- EFA backend: AWS EFA installation with libfabric, libibverbs, efadv, and EFA headers/libraries under `EFA_HOME=/opt/amazon/efa` by default.
- Benchmarks assume homogeneous multi-GPU nodes, `torchrun`, passwordless SSH from node 0 to peer nodes, and routable data-plane IPs in `NODE*_IP`.

## Lite L4 AG+GEMM baseline

For consumer/Ada GPUs such as L40/L4 that cannot run the Hopper-only release
kernels, the lite AG+GEMM path lives under `src/lite`. It implements the
measured fused path without NCCL or cuBLAS. The current L4 target is
tensor-parallel inference AG+GEMM: each rank owns a different local column shard
`B_i`, gathers all `A` rows, and computes its local output shard
`C_i = A_full @ B_i`.

```sh
# Launch this target on both L4 nodes with matching LITE_MASTER_* settings and
# LITE_NODE_RANK=0/1.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 make lite-ag-gemm \
  LITE_PYTHON=python3 \
  LITE_NODE_RANK=0 LITE_MASTER_ADDR=10.10.55.1 \
  LITE_AG_GEMM_MODE=check
```

The benchmark also runs a separate NCCL+cuBLAS full-AllGather baseline for
comparison and reports latency plus TFLOPS/GPU. Only the basic FP32/TF32 TP
baseline is kept in `src/lite`.

## Backends

| Backend | Macro | Transport | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CX7** | `-DINTERNODE_BACKEND_IBVERBS` | libibverbs RC | ConnectX-7 / InfiniBand / RoCE |
| **EFA** | `-DINTERNODE_BACKEND_EFA` | libibverbs + efadv (SRD) | AWS p5/p5e (H200, EFA) |

Both backends share the same host-side API and the same on-GPU kernel; only the proxy / session implementation differs (`include/comm/internode/session.h` for CX7, `session_efa.h` for EFA).
